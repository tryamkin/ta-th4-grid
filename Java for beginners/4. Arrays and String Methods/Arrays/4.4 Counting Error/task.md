##Exercise 4.4
***

Consider the following method, count, which is
intended to traverse all the elements in the
two-dimensional (2D) String array things and
return the total number of elements that contain
at least one `"a"`.

For example, if things contains

`{{"salad", "soup"}, {"water", "coffee"}}`

then `count(things)` should return *2*.

The method does not always work as intended.

####For which of the following two-dimensional array input values does count NOT work as intended?

#####Note: The method `word.indexOf(letter)` will return the first index where the letter is in the word, or -1 if the word doesn't contain the letter.

#####Note 2: Assume the parentheses `()` in the options are actually braces `{}`.
